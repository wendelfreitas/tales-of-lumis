  <i>“I am Seraphynx, creator of this world. Some would call me a god, but I am merely a caretaker. It was I who created humans with the self-awareness to evolve themselves. But I made a lot of mistakes during this creation and I lost control. That concludes the age of the gods. I say it to the new generation of heroes, the mission to reclaim this world is all in your hands." - Seraphynx.</i>

<p align="center">
  The NFT anotomy is easily explained in 3 parts: The central one, which contains the item's pixel art image; the background, which is just a decorative look; the item's frame, which contains three stone slots.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Sun Stone</b>
  <br/>
  Dedicated slot for "Sun" type stones that can apply positive effects to an item. Except for collectible type items.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Moon Stone</b>
  <br/>
  Dedicated slot for "Moon" type stones that can apply positive effects to an item. Except for collectible type items.

</p>

<p align="center">
  Rarity stones are what determine the rarity of an item within the Lumis universe. This does not mean that they will or will not be valued in the real world, just that within the story they have a different degree of importance. They are properly sorted in ascending order in the image above. The same item can exist several times in the universe but never with the same style and rarity, they are extremely unique.

Only one rarity is not documented, the beginner, it represents an item of initial utility only and therefore does not have a specific rarity and can be extremely common within the universe.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Beginner</b>
  <br/>
  It doesn't have a representative stone, it's a very common and easily accessible item in the world of Lumis.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Common</b>
  <br/>
  It is a common item, and may or may not be a collectible.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Rare</b>
  <br/>
  A rare item can be interpreted as a medium rarity, not affecting the main story of Lumis.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Legendary</b>
  <br/>
  Legendary is a high rarity item and can affect the properties of the item itself.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Mystic</b>
  <br/>
  A mystical item is represented as the highest rarity besides divine, items with that rarity can be spawned after the story is affected by other items.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Divine</b>
  <br/>
  Divine, an extremely rare item, has a direct impact on any Lumis story, be it the main and/or side stories of items, maps or collectibles.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <b style="font-size: 35px">
    Is this a real game?
  </b>
  <br/>
  No, Tales of Lumis is just a universe with history, database and connections, think of Lumis as a book where you are part of the story and you can follow it. That doesn't mean that one day Tales of Lumis won't become a game.
</p>
<br/>

<p align="center">
  <b style="font-size: 35px">
  Are you sure I will make money?
  </b>
  <br/>
  We do not guarantee a financial return on any Lumis item or idea.
</p>
<br/>

<p align="center">
  <b style="font-size: 35px">
  Is the story of Tales of Lumis already complete?
  </b>
  <br/>
  No, the story is continuous and progressive, the idea is that everything that happens with the NFT Lumis collection has a direct impact on the story making Tales of Lumis much more dynamic and unique.
</p>
<br/>

<p align="center">
  <b style="font-size: 35px">
  Does Lumis have a dedicated team working just on this?
  </b>
  <br/>
  No, all art, plot, database, website and marketing are being done by me, Wendel Freitas.
</p>

  Can the story, items and map be changed?
  </b>
  <br/>
  Items already released and purchased in a marketplace cannot be changed visually, they can only have minor changes to the story, as well as the map and all other side stories.
